There are some lovely and popular interactive ways to teach, here are a few that you can have a look at and try:

Q and A: Question and answer work can be a great interactive activity for your lessons. This can be an engaging way to see what your students know or have learned from your teachings. Have them write down some questions and then read them out and answer them to the whole class. This can be a nice way to answer questions that multiple students may have but might be embarrassed to ask.

Incident learning: This can be a fun activity that will really help your students with their critical thinking skills. Give them a simple, real life scenario related to what you’re teaching and let them come up with solutions individually or in groups.

Think, pair, share: Put your students into pairs and give them a problem to solve. This could be a worksheet, activity or just talking. By working together they can come up with some great solutions.
Brainstorming: This can be a fascinating method that works in groups or as a whole class. By working together and bouncing ideas off of one another your students can get really creative. All you need is somewhere to write down all the ideas for your students to see.
While a lot of teachers may be hesitant at digitalising their lessons, they should see computers and technology as an essential part of the student's experience.


 Enhanced Engagement & Active Learning: Foster deeper engagement, encouraging active participation and boosting overall course effectiveness. 
Multiple Input Methods: Learners can respond through their own devices (cell phones, tablets, or computers) or hardware clickers.
Interactive Asynchronous Assignments  
Scheduled Interactive Questions: Instructors can set up interactive questions to be completed outside of class, promoting learning beyond the classroom. 
Encourage Peer Collaboration: Learners can see their peers’ responses, fostering better, more productive group work and discussions. 

Students are more likely to stay focused and motivated when they are engaged in hands-on activities, collaborative discussions, and real-world applications of their learning. This heightened engagement not only enhances the overall learning experience but also contributes to better retention of information and improved academic performance.

How Can Interactive Learning Enhance the Teaching and Learning Process?
Improving Student Engagement
One of the most significant impacts of interactive learning is its ability to improve student engagement. By actively involving learners in the educational process, interactive methods create a vibrant classroom atmosphere that encourages participation and enthusiasm.

What Strategies for Interactive Learning Can Educators Use?
Incorporating Technology in Interactive Learning
With the rise of digital learning platforms, incorporating technology into interactive learning has become increasingly vital. Educators can leverage various tools and resources, such as online quizzes, discussion forums, and multimedia presentations, to engage students more effectively.

Using Gamification to Engage Students
Gamification is another powerful strategy for promoting interactive learning. By incorporating game-like elements into educational activities, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, educators can motivate students and make learning more enjoyable.


Gamification taps into students' natural desire for competition and achievement, encouraging them to actively participate in their learning journey. This approach not only boosts engagement but also fosters a sense of accomplishment, as students navigate challenges and achieve their goals in a fun and interactive way.
