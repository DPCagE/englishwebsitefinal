In an ever-developing world, technology is now a concrete part of all of our lives. Introducing children to this at a young age means that their digital literacy is improved and they are confident using technology in their everyday routine. Not only this, but there are proven benefits to learning interactively too:


Inclusive Participation: Give every learner a voice, including those who are reluctant to speak up in class. 
Flexible Question Delivery: Questions can be posed via PowerPoint, videos, or other applications using a floating toolbar or web-based solution. 
 Reveal True Understanding: Interactive questions provide real-time insights into learnersâ€™ understanding throughout a lesson. 

Engagement: Encourage active participation through discussions and feedback.
Networking Opportunities: Foster connections among learners and instructors.
Content Accessibility: Share resources easily to enhance the learning experience.


Project-based learning (PBL) is a widely recognized interactive learning method that involves students working on a project over an extended period. This approach encourages learners to investigate complex questions and challenges while applying their knowledge across multiple disciplines.

Through PBL, students engage in hands-on activities, research, and collaboration, culminating in a final product or presentation that showcases their learning. This method not only enhances critical thinking and problem-solving skills but also allows for a deeper exploration of topics, making learning relevant and engaging.


Flipped Classroom Approaches
The flipped classroom model is another innovative interactive learning method that redefines traditional teaching roles. In this approach, students are introduced to new content at home, often through online videos or readings, and then engage in interactive activities during class time.

This allows educators to focus on hands-on learning experiences and collaborative discussions, maximizing the time spent on active learning. By flipping the classroom, educators promote self-directed learning and empower students to take charge of their education while benefiting from meaningful interactions with peers and instructors.
